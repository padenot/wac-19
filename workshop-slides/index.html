  # macOS users

  Install xcode and run `xcode-select --install` now !

  Also I hope you don't have Catalina (10.15)

  # 2020 - Year of the `AudioWorklet`

  ---

  class: center, middle

  # It's time to aim higher

  ---

  # The standard native audio programming requirements

  - A low-latency true real-time input/output audio callback
  - Computational speed without garbage collection
  - Shared memory between threads
  - Atomic accesses to (shared) memory
  - SIMD

  ---

  # Native audio APIs characteristics

  - Real-time
  - Low-latency (small buffer size)

  ---

  # Real-time

  - Predictable run time (no gc, no waiting on something else, just computations)
  - Scheduled faster than other threads on the machine
  - Resilient against arbitraty machine load
  - CoreAudio, WASAPI, Jack, PulseAudio, Android OpenSL ES/AAudio, etc.

  ---

  # Low latency

  - Short code-to-ear time
  - Means small buffers
  - Buffer size != latency
  - A few dozen milliseconds typical for one-way latency (highly dependant on the OS, setup, driver, hardware, software, etc.)

  ---

  # Computational speed without GC

  - Traditionaly C++ (the industry standard), C
  - Assembly and SIMD instrinsics for hot code
  - Rust works very well and is way more ergonomic and modern
  - GC introduces non-determinism (even very good ones), can't be used

  ---

  # Shared memory between arbitraty threads

  - Can't afford to copy too much data (large audio buffers, etc.)
  - Can't afford block threads to communicate

  ---

  # Atomic accesses to (shared) memory

  - Allows writing the classic audio data structure, the SPSC wait-free ring buffer
  - Necessary to communicate without blocking and/or accessing too much atomics
  - Used for control message queues, audio FIFOs, etc.

  ---


  # SIMD

  - **S**ingle **I**nstruction, **M**ultiple **D**ata
  - Execute DSP code faster
  - That's it üëç

  ---

  # Mapping to the web platform

  - Low latency real-time audio callback: `AudioContext`/`AudioWorklet`
  - Computational speed: WASM
  - Shared memory between threads: `SharedArrayBuffer`
  - Atomics accesses to shared memory: `Atomic` functions over `SharedArrayBuffer`
  - SIMD: Web Assembly 128-bit packed SIMD extension

  ---

  # Low latency real-time input/output audio callback

  - `AudioContext`/`AudioWorklet`/`getUserMedia`
  - Latency and resilience depending on browser/OS/drivers/hardware/direction of wind
  - Firefox on macOS and Linux/Jack: 128 frames buffer at the OS level (&lt;10ms round trip)
  - True real-time thread on all platforms, nothing blocking
  - Coupled input-output streams, no extra buffering for round-trip
  - YMMV on other browsers

  ---

  # Computational speed: WASM

  - Write in C, C++, Rust, AssemblyScript, Faust, Soul, etc...
  - Predictable performances, portable anywhere:
    - All browser engines (Gecko/Blink/WebKit)
    - node.js
    - [Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) !
  - High and deterministic performances, will only get faster (smarter compiler,
  more WASM features)

  ---

  # Shared memory between threads: `SharedArrayBuffer`

  - `SharedArrayBuffer` introduced a few years back
  - Spectre came and ruined everything
  - Back soon‚Ñ¢ with special headers for security (a bit like CORS)
  - MDN article explaining everything: [Planned changes to shared
  memory](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer/Planned_changes)

  ---

  # Shared memory between threads: `SharedArrayBuffer`

  - Special Firefox builds to try it out during the workshop (to avoid server
  setup etc.)
  - Caveat: quickly hacked up by a colleague for the purpose of this workshop,
  less responsive that a normal build, but WASM and Web Audio performances are
  representative of what's coming (should actually get faster)
  - Shows in devtools opening time, general tab bar responsiveness, etc.
  - Sorry üôè (it has a cool and edgy logo though)

  ---

  # Atomics accesses to shared memory: `Atomic` functions over `SharedArrayBuffer`

  - A bit weird to code for at first, not the end of the world
  - Don't use `Atomic.notify` and `Atomic.wait` in real-time code!
  - `Atomic.wait` is disabled on the main thread and in `AudioWorkletGlobalScope` anyways
  - Please think **extremely carefuly** when implementing lock-free data
    structure and/or borrow code from people who have battle tested/proven their
    implementation

  ---

  # SIMD: Web Assembly 128-bit packed SIMD extension

  - Roughly SSE2 like feature set
  - For audio, 4 32-bits floats per lane
  - IEEE754 arithmeric AND integer arithmetic
  - `min`/`max`/`shuffle`/`sqrt`/comparisons/saturating arithmetic
  - Chrome only for now, Firefox currently implementing ([bug
  1478632](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1478632))

  # Shortcomings (at this time)

  - [Bulk memory
  operations](https://github.com/WebAssembly/bulk-memory-operations/blob/master/proposals/bulk-memory-operations/Overview.md)
  - [WASM
  threads](https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads/blob/master/proposals/threads/Overview.md)
  - [Multi
  memory](https://github.com/WebAssembly/multi-memory/blob/master/proposals/multi-memory/Overview.md)
  - WASM toolchain being readied for multi-threading, pretty rough right now
    - Rust WASM target works well (a few caveats)
    - Emscripten works OK, but not in standalone mode
  - No way to create other real-time threads on the Web Plaform right now, workers are too dangerous (priority inversion)

  # We're the end of the beginning of real-time audio on the Web

  ---

  # A little peak at the future

  - Rust multi-threaded raytracer using high-level concurrency primitives (`rayon`)
  - Compiled to WASM
  - Running on multiple threads
  - Communicating with lock free multiple-producer multiple consumer message queue compiled without modification from Rust
  - Using a `SharedArrayBuffer` for the WASM heap
  - [Demo](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/exbuild/raytrace-parallel/) (Firefox only for now)

  ---

  # Another little peak at the future

  - Single producer single consumer wait-free general purpose or audio ring
  buffer written in C++11 **without code modification**
  - Unit/stress tests written using `std::thread`
  - Direct copy of production-quality code extracted from Firefox
  - Compiled with emscripten (one-liner `Makefile`)
  - [Demo](http://localhost:8886) (Firefox only for now)

  # Workshop time !

  - `git clone https://github.com/padenot/wac-19-audioworklet-workshop.git`
  - A little real-time programming primer
  - Compare WASM (C++/Rust) vs. JS for DSP code
  - Write DSP code like a native audio dev
    - Choose a language (C++/Rust code provided, others possible)
    - Write an `AudioWorletProcessor` that has fixed parameter value
    - Modify it to uses `postMessage` for parameter control
    - Modify it to only `postMessage` during setup, using `SharedArrayBuffer` for
    communication, and remove all GC pressure
    - Performance considerations and discussion

  # Load and resilience test

  - <span class=math tex="Load"></span>, load factor, unitless
  - <span class=math tex="T_{rendering}"></span>, time it takes to render _n_
  frames of audio
  - <span class=math tex="T_{duration}"></span>, duration of those _n_
  frames of audio


  <span class="math center"  tex="Load = \frac{T_{rendering}}{T_{duration}}"></span>

  - When load is &lt; 1.0, it's OK
  - When load is&gt; 1.0, it's over
  - A series of values, computed for _each_ audio callback

  ---

  # The standard deviation of the load matters

  <img src="stddev.png" width="100%"></img>

  ---

  # Load standard deviation

  <span class="math center" tex="\displaystyle s={\sqrt {{\frac {1}{N-1}}\sum _{i=1}^{N}(x_{i}-{\bar {x}})^{2}}},"></span>

  > Square root of the sum of the differences between each values and the mean, squared

  ---

  # Why does it matter

  - Try to have the smallest standard deviation of the load, and decide on maximum "safe" load
  - Have a sense of the "real-timeness" of an algorithm
  - The [68‚Äì95‚Äì99.7 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule)
  - Worst case time matters more than mean or median time

  ---

  # Load metrics for programmers

  Given an array `load` containing the load values:

  ```js
  // Mean
  var sum = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < load.length; i++) {
    sum += load[i];
  }
  var mean = sum / load.length;

  // Variance
  var variance = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < load.length; i++) {
    variance += Math.pow(load[i] - mean, 2);
  }
  variance /= load.length;

  // Standard deviation
  stddev = Math.sqrt(variance);
  ```

  ---

  # Firefox tooling

  ```
  MOZ_LOG=AudioCallbackTracing:5,raw,sync \
    MOZ_LOG_FILE=tracing.log ./firefox
  ```

  This produces a "load trace", that can be used in a series of tools
  (Chromium/catapult trace format), but is just simple JSON.

  [MediaStreamGraph load
  analyzer](https://padenot.github.io/msg-load-analyzer/) is a web app that
  computes load metrics for a particular trace, detecting underruns

  ---

  # Try it on your machine

  - Get a build for your config (<https://pad.paul.cx/wac-19>)
  - Start the web server (`node server.js`)
  - Compare programming languages, browsers, machines, OS, hardware (headphones, speakers, external sound card, etc.)
  - Add internal load (something on the page doing something on the main thread)
  - Add external load (something on the machine, e.g. `stress --cpu 8` or
  <https://paul.cx/public/loadtest.html>)
  - Take measurements and determine what setup is preferable for a robust program

  ---

  # Feedback delay network

  - pre-delay
  - parallel or sequential delay lines or all passes
  - feedback path
  - diffusion matrix
  - low-pass for absorbtion
  - saturator to allow creative feedback effects
