  ```

  - BBC, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Mozilla, W3C, etc.
  - Quite a few people not affiliated
  - Always thankfull for typo fix, etc.

  # News in the browser engine market

  - Edge moves to Chromium
  - Servo now has a Web Audio API implementation (not complete at all but
  promising), open for contributions (please ask, it's all in Rust and it's
  coolüòé)

  # Administrative stuff

  - Raymond Toy from Google is now co-chair of the WG, stepped down as a
  co-editor (but still do edits!)
  - Hongchan Choi from Google replaced Raymond as a co-editor

  # New in the spec

  # What's new since WAC'18

  - Fixes are in (rough) chronological order
  - Some issue resolutions are small, took 10min to fix
  - Some issue resolutions are small, took 7 years to fix
  - A long series of little changes

  ---

  # Buffers

  - `ConvolverNode.buffer`, `WaveShaperNode.curve` can be set more than once
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è  Setting `ConvolverNode.buffer` is synchronous on the main thread
  - Tried to change it, failed miserably
  - <https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api-v2/issues/28>

  ---

  # Define what linear PCM is

  - No kidding
  - Kind of important
  - <https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#audio-sample-format>

  ---

  # Tail time vs. channel count

  - Talked about last time
  - Fix now in the spec (but decided last year)
  - <https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#AudioNode-tail>
  - <https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#channels-tail-time>

  ---

  # A metric ton of AudioWorklet fixes

  - Hardest part is `WebIDL` and `ECMAScript` integration
  - Implication of `WebIDL` types on GC
  - Lots and lots of things were undefined/underspecified/allowed to do bad
  things
  - Thanks to proof readers, reviewers and implementers
  - A couple fixes missing at the moment, getting there

  ---

  # PannerNode vs. AudioListener

  - Order of computation wasn't defined, is now in the ["Rendering an audio
  graph"](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#rendering-loop) section

  ---

  # MediaStreamTrack AudioSourceNode legacy nonsense

  - <https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#MediaStreamAudioSourceNode-constructors>
  - Doesn't reflect changes the `MediaStream`
  - One channel of silence when `ended`

  ---

  # Auto-play policy

  - \#1 polarizing topic
  - Simple provisions in the spec to allow:
    - `start()` on `ScheduldSource` to change `"allowed to start"`
    - `resume()` on `AudioContext` as well
  - Implementation wise, behaviours vary
  - Generally safe to call `resume()` from a click/touch handler

  ---

  # OfflineAudioContext.suspend rounding

  - Rounded up, otherwise it's very confusing

  ---

  # Biquad/other filter instability

  - We can't do anything
  - Suggestion of printing a message in the console, flush `NaN` to zero

  ---

  # AudioNode disconnect when it wasn't connected

  - This now throws
  - Surprisingly, it didn't use to

  ---

  # AudioParam value getter

  - Now specified (it took only 6 or 7 years of discussion)
  - Returns the current automation value at `currentTime` **without** the audio input

  ---

  # BiquadFilterNode. getFrequencyResponse

  - Uses the `AudioParam` value getter, i.e. the current automation value

  ---

  # copyFromChannel copyToChannel

  - When the parameter end up making the function call "useless" (0 samples
  copy), do nothing instead of throwing
  - Edge cases clarified (off-by-one)

  ---

  # AudioParam vs. NaN

  - Now flushed to the default `AudioParam` value
  - Was _probably_ flushed to 0 before (which doesn't make sense for some
  `AudioParam`s)

  ---

  # Convolver channel flexibility

  - Now the channel count and the channel count mode is allowed to be set
  - Useful for performances (being able to save the cost of a convolution is nice)

  ---

  # AudioBufferSourceNode reverse playback

  - If started after the looping points, but playing in reverse, symmetrical
  with playback forward and started before the looping region

  ---

  # Things that couldn't make it

  - `cancelAndHoldAtTime` precise specification ([web-audio-api-v2#3](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api-v2/issues/3))
  - Clarify behavior when `DelayNode` output is connected back to `delayTime`
  `AudioParam`, creating a cycle
  ([web-audio-api-v2#50](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api-v2/issues/50))
  - We'll probably find something soon right after saying we're done

  ---

  # Security and privacy consideration section

  - Again
  - We're now convinced the fingerprinting is merely characterizing the floating
  point implementation of the machine and the specific algorithm that the
  implementation uses
  - Spoofing of `AudioDestinationNode.maxChannelCount` and
  `AudioContext.sampleRate` available in Firefox

  ---

  # Web Audio API is <del>now</del> still a W3C Candidate Recommendation

  - Charter extension
  - Need 2 distinct implementations with all features (basically need
  `AudioWorklet` in Firefox, that's coming super soon)
  - [wpt.fyi](https://wpt.fyi/results/webaudio?label=experimental&label=master&aligned)

  # What's next

  ---

  # V2

  - <https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api-v2/issues>
  - New repo, go and write issues
  - Old issues moved (link not broken, redirects in place)
  - The [project board](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api-v2/projects/1)
  allows checking the status of feature

  ---

  # Random assorted topics (a personal selection)

  - `AudioWorklet` + `WASM` + `SharedArrayBuffer`
  - Oscillator fixes:
    - Noise
    - Oscillator hard sync
    - Pulse width
    - Non-bandlimited (for modulation)
  - Audio output device selection
  - Render quantum size changes (lower than 128 samples)

  ---

  # Help wanted

  - (Please please please) think very hard about what you need
  - (Please please please) write prototypes
  - (Please please please) don't open issues on things that are already possible
  - (Please please please) don't open issues on implementations (use the
  vendor's tracker)

  ---

  # How to help us

  - Have you or your company join the community/working group
  - Discuss on GitHub
  - Write Web Platform Tests
  - Contribute patches to implementations (Happy to mentor for Firefox)
